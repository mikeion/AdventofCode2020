{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Day 2: Password Philosophy \nYour flight departs in a few days from the coastal airport; the easiest way down to the coast from here is via toboggan.\n\nThe shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day. \"Something's wrong with our computers; we can't log in!\" You ask if you can take a look.\n\nTheir password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan \nCorporate Policy that was in effect when they were chosen.\n\nTo try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords \n(according to the corrupted database) and the corporate policy when that password was set.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following list:\n\n1-3 a: abcde\n1-3 b: cdefg\n2-9 c: ccccccccc\nEach line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest \nand highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, \n1-3 a means that the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.\n\nIn the above example, 2 passwords are valid. The middle password, cdefg, is not; it contains no instances of b, \nbut needs at least 1. The first and third passwords are valid: they contain one a or nine c, both within the limits \nof their respective policies.\n\nHow many passwords are valid according to their policies?","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-a47dd9d5-9781-4f22-9912-93fafdc56b3d","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-982be596-65dc-4a71-b7d7-0379f88adb76","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"73fee210","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1607432847128,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import re\n\nlist_of_pw = list(map(str, open('../data/day02_input.txt', 'r').read().split('\\n')))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-813a1aef-0dc1-4a93-9852-ac5bb6f91f76","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"3bc6d9f","execution_millis":1,"execution_start":1607432851920,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"def valid_password_part1(letter, minimum, maximum, password):\n    count = password.count(letter)\n    if minimum <= count <= maximum:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-ad2d3efb-193a-42cb-bd18-7cba45efe66b","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"61991124","execution_millis":7,"execution_start":1607432852508,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"def how_many_valid_pw_part1(list_of_pw):\n    valid_passwords = 0\n    for pw in list_of_pw:\n        minimum, maximum = int(re.findall(r'(\\d+)', pw)[0]), int(re.findall(r'(\\d+)', pw)[1])\n        letter, password = re.findall(r'([a-z]+)', pw)[0], re.findall(r'([a-z]+)', pw)[1]\n        if valid_password_part1(letter,minimum, maximum, password) is True:\n            valid_passwords +=1\n        \n    print(f'The number of valid passwords is {valid_passwords}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00007-70288254-40db-4598-9b15-7cf7f286b8e5","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"af9c455e","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1607432854016,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"how_many_valid_pw_part1(list_of_pw)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"The number of valid passwords is 483\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## --- Part Two ---\nWhile it appears you validated the passwords correctly, they don't seem to be what the Official Toboggan Corporate Authentication System is expecting.\n\nThe shopkeeper suddenly realizes that he just accidentally explained the password policy rules from his old job at the sled rental place down the street!
