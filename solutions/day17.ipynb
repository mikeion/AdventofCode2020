When you hear it's \nhaving problems, you can't help but agree to take a look.\n\nThe pocket dimension contains an infinite 3-dimensional grid. At every integer 3-dimensional coordinate (x,y,z), there exists a single cube which \nis either active or inactive.\n\nIn the initial state of the pocket dimension, almost all cubes start inactive. The only exception to this is a small flat region of cubes \n(your puzzle input); the cubes in this region start in the specified active (#) or inactive (.) state.\n\nThe energy source then proceeds to boot up by executing six cycles.\n\nEach cube only ever considers its neighbors: any of the 26 other cubes where any of their coordinates differ by at most 1. For example, given \nthe cube at x=1,y=2,z=3, its neighbors include the cube at x=2,y=2,z=2, the cube at x=0,y=2,z=3, and so on.\n\nDuring a cycle, all cubes simultaneously change their state according to the following rules:\n```\n    If a cube is active and exactly 2 or 3 of its neighbors are also active, the cube remains active. Otherwise, the cube becomes inactive.\n    If a cube is inactive but exactly 3 of its neighbors are active, the cube becomes active. Otherwise, the cube remains inactive.\n```\nThe engineers responsible for this experimental energy source would like you to simulate the pocket dimension and determine what the configuration \nof cubes should be at the end of the six-cycle boot process.\n\nFor example, consider the following initial state:\n```\n.#.\n..#\n###\n```\nEven though the pocket dimension is 3-dimensional, this initial state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In particular, this initial state defines \na 3x3x1 region of the 3-dimensional space.)\n\nSimulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown layer-by-layer at each \ngiven z coordinate (and the frame of view follows the active cells in each cycle):\n\nBefore any cycles:\n```\nz=0\n.#.\n..#\n###\n```\n\nAfter 1 cycle:\n```\nz=-1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=0\n#.#\n.##\n.#.\n\nz=1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\n```\nAfter 2 cycles:\n```\nz=-2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1\n..#..\n.#..#\n....#\n.#...\n.....\n\nz=0\n##...\n##...\n#....\n....#\n.###.\n\nz=1\n..#..\n.#..#\n....#\n.#...\n.....\n\nz=2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n```\n\nAfter 3 cycles:\n```\nz=-2\n.......\n.......\n..##...\n..###..\n.......\n.......\n.......\n\nz=-1\n..#....\n...#...\n#......\n.....##\n.#...#.\n..#.#..\n...#...\n\nz=0\n...#...\n.......\n#......\n.......\n.....##\n.##.#..\n...#...\n\nz=1\n..#....\n...#...\n#......\n.....##\n.#...#.\n..#.#..\n...#...\n\nz=2\n.......\n.......\n..##...\n..###..\n.......\n.......\n.......\n```\nAfter the full six-cycle boot process completes, 112 cubes are left in the active state.\n\nStarting with your given initial configuration, simulate six cycles. **How many cubes are left in the active state after the sixth cycle?**","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-3ed76854-7119-42ff-a71b-55c3b8986148","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-baf7c937-8dea-40c8-9526-ffbc6ebefe3c","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"7a5996b8","execution_millis":0,"execution_start":1608828740876,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import copy\nimport itertools\ndata = list(map(str, open('../data/day17_input.txt', 'r').read().split('\\n')))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-2e850be4-90f2-4a9d-a275-84884fdbf8b8","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"e6928a8f","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1608816200792,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":4,"data":{"text/plain":"['.#.#..##',\n '..#....#',\n '##.####.',\n '...####.',\n '#.##..##',\n '#...##..',\n '...##.##',\n '#...#.#.']"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-555044a4-8d1c-435a-9579-baa2595e7581","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"bb56872c","execution_millis":1,"execution_start":1608828095132,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"def part_1(d):\n    rows = len(d)\n    columns = len(d[0])\n    cycles = 6\n    expanded = 42\n    grid = [[['.' for y in range(columns + expanded)] for x in range(rows + expanded)] for z in range(1 + expanded)]\n    print(len(grid[0]))\n    # Need to put our initial grid in the middle of this one we created.\n\n    # Run through 6 cycles:\n    for cycle in range(cycles):\n        new_grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)\n        range_expanded = 2 * (cycle + 1)\n        for i in range(1 + range_expanded):\n            for j in range(rows+ range_expanded):\n                for k in range(columns + range_expanded):\n                    count_active = 0\n                    for z in itertools.product([0,-1,1], repeat=3):\n                        if not(z==(0,0,0)) and \n        ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-7dedbca8-985b-438c-b93f-525a7ac695b7","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"for index_row, row in enumerate(data):\n        for index_column, column in enumerate(row):\n            grid[cycles][index_row + cycles][index_column + cycles] = column\n    # Time to run the cycles\n\n    for cycle in range(cycles):\n        new_grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-e8c3c476-3b13-4677-8693-028090915623","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"be8a30d8","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1608828097097,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"part_1(data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"50\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-7e501368-831a-49af-9ef0-b704b6819ed7","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"4dcb007e","execution_millis":3,"execution_start":1608828815989,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"for z in itertools.product([0, -1, 1], repeat=3):\n    print(z[0])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00007-68165a94-08aa-405e-a186-a97cf9740965","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"bc02ef63-2602-432a-9907-113f8e0df8a9","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
