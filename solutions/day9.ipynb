{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Day 9: Encoding Error \nWith your neighbor happily enjoying their video game, you turn your attention to an open data port on the little screen in the seat in front of you.\n\nThough the port is non-standard, you manage to connect it to your computer through the clever use of several paperclips. \nUpon connection, the port outputs a series of numbers (your puzzle input).\n\nThe data appears to be encrypted with the eXchange-Masking Addition System (XMAS) which, conveniently for you, is an old cypher \nwith an important weakness.\n\nXMAS starts by transmitting a preamble of 25 numbers. After that, each number you receive should be the sum of any two of the 25 \nimmediately previous numbers. The two numbers will have different values, and there might be more than one such pair.\n\nFor example, suppose your preamble consists of the numbers 1 through 25 in a random order. To be valid, the next number must be the \nsum of two of those numbers:\n\n26 would be a valid next number, as it could be 1 plus 25 (or many other pairs, like 2 and 24).  \n49 would be a valid next number, as it is the sum of 24 and 25.  \n100 would not be valid; no two of the previous 25 numbers sum to 100.  \n50 would also not be valid; although 25 appears in the previous 25 numbers, the two numbers in the pair must be different.  \nSuppose the 26th number is 45, and the first number (no longer an option, as it is more than 25 numbers ago) was 20. Now, for the next number to be valid, \nthere needs to be some pair of numbers among 1-19, 21-25, or 45 that add up to it:\n\n26 would still be a valid next number, as 1 and 25 are still within the previous 25 numbers.\n65 would not be valid, as no two of the available numbers sum to it.\n64 and 66 would both be valid, as they are the result of 19+45 and 21+45 respectively.\nHere is a larger example which only considers the previous 5 numbers (and has a preamble of length 5):\n```\n35\n20\n15\n25\n47\n40\n62\n55\n65\n95\n102\n117\n150\n182\n127\n219\n299\n277\n309\n576\n```\nIn this example, after the 5-number preamble, almost every number is the sum of two of the previous 5 numbers; \nthe only number that does not follow this rule is 127.\n\nThe first step of attacking the weakness in the XMAS data is to find the first number in the list (after the preamble) \nwhich is not the sum of two of the 25 numbers before it. What is the first number that does not have this property?","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-c6ad1913-af77-4239-84b1-ab419ae7bfc6","output_cleared":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-4bd497c9-f876-44e2-a34f-0b635783ca61","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"7748ab4d","execution_millis":1,"execution_start":1607543937304,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"data = list(map(int, open('../data/day9_input.txt', 'r').read().split('\\n')))","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"example = list(map(int, open('../examples/day9_example.txt', 'r').read().split('\\n')))","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-ac43043f-d88c-4c10-802b-b4217788028c","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"b321376b","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1607544143778,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def find_sums(l, p):\n    sums = []\n    for i, x in enumerate(l[:p]): # This will go over all the left hand numbers first\n        for j, y in enumerate(l[:p]):\n            if (i==j) | (i > j) : # This will make sure we aren't double counting the same number twice.\n                continue\n            else:\n                sums.append(x+y)\n    return sums","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-2bf43369-0c64-4f50-a0c3-0eec5b81fe58","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"798993f","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1607543937311,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"We'll begin by creating a list of sums from the preamble.
