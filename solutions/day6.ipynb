{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Day 6: Custom Customs \n\nAs your flight approaches the regional airport where you'll switch to a much \nlarger plane, customs declaration forms are distributed to the passengers.\n\nThe form asks a series of 26 yes-or-no questions marked a through z. \nAll you need to do is identify the questions for which anyone in your \ngroup answers \"yes\". Since your group is just you, this doesn't take very long.\n\nHowever, the person sitting next to you seems to be experiencing a language barrier \nand asks if you can help. For each of the people in their group, you write down the \nquestions for which they answer \"yes\", one per line. For example:\n\n```\nabcx\nabcy\nabcz\n```\n\nIn this group, there are 6 questions to which anyone answered \"yes\": a, b, c, x, y, and z. \n(Duplicate answers to the same question don't count extra; each question counts at most once.)\n\nAnother group asks for your help, then another, and eventually you've collected answers from \nevery group on the plane (your puzzle input). Each group's answers are separated by a blank line, \nand within each group, each person's answers are on a single line. For example:\n\n```\nabc\n\na\nb\nc\n\nab\nac\n\na\na\na\na\n\nb`\n```\nThis list represents answers from five groups:\n\nThe first group contains one person who answered \"yes\" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.\nThe second group contains three people; combined, they answered \"yes\" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.\nThe third group contains two people; combined, they answered \"yes\" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.\nThe fourth group contains four people; combined, they answered \"yes\" to only 1 question, a.\nThe last group contains one person who answered \"yes\" to only 1 question, b.\nIn this example, the sum of these counts is 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11.\n\nFor each group, count the number of questions to which anyone answered \"yes\". What is the \nsum of those counts?","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-1e08ad5f-4c60-4555-a001-761e133cf733","output_cleared":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-34017007-f0da-4d79-837c-94bd182962c8","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"7c382d99","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1607433023071,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"forms = list(map(str, open('../data/day6_input.txt', 'r').read().split('\\n\\n')))\nforms = [form.replace('\\n', ' ').split() for form in forms]","execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-6750407a-3da2-410e-b947-ad77c0fce8a4","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"c102a3d5","execution_millis":7,"execution_start":1607433023075,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"def total_customs_declarations(forms, part):\n    sum = 0\n    for form in forms:\n        d_temp = {}\n        no_of_people = len(form) # for part 2\n        for s in form:\n            for letter in s:\n                if letter not in d_temp:\n                    d_temp[letter] = 1\n                else:\n                    d_temp[letter] +=1\n        if part == 1:\n            sum += len(d_temp)\n        else:\n            for key, value in d_temp.items():\n                if value == no_of_people:\n                    sum += 1\n    return(sum)","execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-710c82b6-28e6-4436-adbe-672e3bb4ca50","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"1ff259c3","execution_millis":7,"execution_start":1607433023084,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Answer for Part 1\ntotal_customs_declarations(forms,1)","execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":7,"data":{"text/plain":"6249"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part Two \n\nAs you finish the last group's customs declaration, you notice that you misread one \nword in the instructions:\n\nYou don't need to identify the questions to which anyone answered \"yes\"; you need to \nidentify the questions to which everyone answered \"yes\"!\n\nUsing the same example as above:\n\n```\nabc\n\na\nb\nc\n\nab\nac\n\na\na\na\na\n\nb\n```\nThis list represents answers from five groups:\n\nIn the first group, everyone (all 1 person) answered \"yes\" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.\nIn the second group, there is no question to which everyone answered \"yes\".\nIn the third group, everyone answered yes to only 1 question, a.
