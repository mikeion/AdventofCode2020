{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Day 16: Ticket Translation\n\nAs you're walking to yet another connecting flight, you realize that one of the legs of \nyour re-routed trip coming up is on a high-speed train. However, the train ticket you were \ngiven is in a language you don't understand. You should probably figure out what it says \nbefore you get to the train station after the next flight.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't actually read the words on the ticket. You can, however, read the \nnumbers, and so you figure out the fields these tickets must have and the valid ranges for \nvalues in those fields.\n\nYou collect the rules for ticket fields, the numbers on your ticket, and the numbers on other \nnearby tickets for the same train service (via the airport security cameras) together into a \nsingle document you can reference (your puzzle input).\n\nThe rules for ticket fields specify a list of fields that exist somewhere on the ticket \nand the valid ranges of values for each field. For example, a rule like class: 1-3 or 5-7 \nmeans that one of the fields in every ticket is named class and can be any value in the \nranges 1-3 or 5-7 (inclusive, such that 3 and 5 are both valid in this field, but 4 is not).\n\nEach ticket is represented by a single line of comma-separated values. The values are the \nnumbers on the ticket in the order they appear; every ticket has the same format. For example, \nconsider this ticket:\n```\n.--------------------------------------------------------.\n| ????: 101    ?????: 102   ??????????: 103     ???: 104 |\n|                                                        |\n| ??: 301  ??: 302             ???????: 303      ??????? |\n| ??: 401  ??: 402           ???? ????: 403    ????????? |\n'--------------------------------------------------------'\n```\nHere, ? represents text in a language you don't understand. This ticket might be represented \nas 101,102,103,104,301,302,303,401,402,403; of course, the actual train tickets you're looking \nat are much more complicated. In any case, you've extracted just the numbers in such a way \nthat the first number is always the same specific field, the second number is always a different \nspecific field, and so on - you just don't know what each position actually means!\n\nStart by determining which tickets are completely invalid; these are tickets that contain \nvalues which aren't valid for any field. Ignore your ticket for now.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following notes:\n\nclass: 1-3 or 5-7\nrow: 6-11 or 33-44\nseat: 13-40 or 45-50\n\nyour ticket:\n7,1,14\n\nnearby tickets:\n7,3,47\n40,4,50\n55,2,20\n38,6,12\n\nIt doesn't matter which position corresponds to which field; you can identify invalid nearby \ntickets by considering only whether tickets contain values that are not valid for any field. \nIn this example, the values on the first nearby ticket are all valid for at least one field. \nThis is not true of the other three nearby tickets: the values 4, 55, and 12 are are not valid \nfor any field. Adding together all of the invalid values produces your ticket scanning error \nrate: 4 + 55 + 12 = 71.\n\nConsider the validity of the nearby tickets you scanned. **What is your ticket scanning error rate?**","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-ea555d49-ff7f-4625-8b6e-4a0081a620e7","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-43bcac32-949e-44e5-abd4-18be50452822","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import re","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-09b9e682-2f80-4373-beea-4c25dd869383","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"41930bec","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1608739888765,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = list(map(str, open(f'../data/day16_input.txt', 'r').read().split('\\n')))\ndata = list(filter(None, data))","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-714ebb32-e107-4032-ac56-5f0d72a57fe1","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"8c3584f9","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1608739889698,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def parse_data(d):\n    restrictions = [list(map(int, re.findall('\\d+', line))) for line in d[:20]]\n    my_ticket = [int(x) for x in data[21].split(',')]\n    nearby_tickets = [list(map(int, line.split(','))) for line in d[23:]]\n    return restrictions, my_ticket, nearby_tickets","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-33284017-9e19-4f2b-b4f6-dc9ea136fd41","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"c0024bfd","execution_millis":0,"execution_start":1608740655964,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def check_valid(field, restrictions):\n    validity = []\n    for restriction in restrictions:\n        validity.append((restriction[0] <= field <= restriction[1]) | (restriction[2] <= field <= restriction[3]))\n    return any(validity)\n        ","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-3a8c16d2-c39f-4f40-b206-48dadadc5000","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"8c5984f0","execution_millis":0,"execution_start":1608740658983,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":26},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def part1(d):\n    sum = 0\n    r, m_t, n_t = parse_data(d)\n    for index, ticket in enumerate(n_t):\n        for field in ticket:\n            if not check_valid(field, r):\n                sum += field\n    print(f'sum is {sum}')","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-4d0ca356-f7ee-494e-a7f3-cdfc0d3fa968","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"96040336","execution_millis":0,"execution_start":1608740702076,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":29},{"cell_type":"code","source":"part1(data)","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00007-69a6dd29-f384-4fc2-8dcb-406c17a82003","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"2cecd01c","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1608740704163,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"sum is 25961\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":30},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 2\n\nNow that you have identified which tickets contain invalid values, \ndiscard those tickets entirely.
