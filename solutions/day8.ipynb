While you consider checking the in-flight menu \nfor one of those drinks that come with a little umbrella, you are interrupted by the kid sitting next to you.\n\nTheir handheld game console won't turn on! They ask if you can take a look.\n\nYou narrow the problem down to a strange infinite loop in the boot code (your puzzle input) of the device. \nYou should be able to fix it, but first you need to be able to run the code in isolation.\n\nThe boot code is represented as a text file with one instruction per line of text. Each instruction consists of an operation \n(acc, jmp, or nop) and an argument (a signed number like +4 or -20).\n\nacc increases or decreases a single global value called the accumulator by the value given in the argument. For example, acc +7 would increase the accumulator \nby 7. The accumulator starts at 0. After an acc instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.\njmp jumps to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an offset from the jmp instruction; \nfor example, jmp +2 would skip the next instruction, jmp +1 would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and jmp -20 \nwould cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.\nnop stands for No OPeration - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it is executed next.\nFor example, consider the following program:\n```\nnop +0\nacc +1\njmp +4\nacc +3\njmp -3\nacc -99\nacc +1\njmp -4\nacc +6\n```\nThese instructions are visited in this order:\n```\nnop +0  | 1\nacc +1  | 2, 8(!)\njmp +4  | 3\nacc +3  | 6\njmp -3  | 7\nacc -99 |\nacc +1  | 4\njmp -4  | 5\nacc +6  |\n```\nFirst, the nop +0 does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (acc +1) \nand jmp +4 sets the next instruction to the other acc +1 near the bottom. \nAfter it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, jmp -4 executes, setting the next instruction to the only acc +3. It sets the accumulator to 5, \nand jmp -3 causes the program to continue back at the first acc +1.\n\nThis is an infinite loop: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the program tries to run any instruction a second time, \nyou know it will never terminate.\n\nImmediately before the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator is 5.\n\nRun your copy of the boot code. Immediately before any instruction is executed a second time, what value is in the accumulator?","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-d3ce359e-f7e3-4345-9f75-3d0f7842756c","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-dbb77680-3fb9-427e-92d2-8182f71b5f3b","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"41930bec","execution_millis":0,"execution_start":1607428558519,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import re","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-17e2f8b0-4503-477c-b131-0466beb92339","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"c0625c39","execution_millis":3,"execution_start":1607428559283,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"instructions = list(map(str, open('../data/day8_input.txt', 'r').read().split('\\n')))","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-f84c5730-0dc9-4275-a711-c8cc37045a00","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"8774178d","execution_millis":3,"execution_start":1607428560117,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"instructions[0:5]","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":29,"data":{"text/plain":"['acc +7', 'acc +23', 'acc +41', 'jmp +173', 'acc -17']"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-48f38431-cc0c-4094-97e0-8228007d1371","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"aca5adb","execution_millis":0,"execution_start":1607428950683,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"def run_program(instructions):\n    d_count = {} # empty dictionary to store counts of list index.

By changing exactly one jmp or nop, you can repair the boot code and make it terminate correctly.\n\nFor example, consider the same program from above:\n```\nnop +0\nacc +1\njmp +4\nacc +3\njmp -3\nacc -99\nacc +1\njmp -4\nacc +6\n```\nIf you change the first instruction from nop +0 to jmp +0, it would create a single-instruction infinite loop, never leaving that instruction. \nIf you change almost any of the jmp instructions, the program will still eventually find another jmp instruction and loop forever.\n\nHowever, if you change the second-to-last instruction (from jmp -4 to nop -4), the program terminates!

The top reply by `u/lasagnaman` is pretty fascinating.\n> Let $C$ be the initial set of commands. We can compute the set WINNING of positions that will eventually lead to a victory (in $C$) in $O(N)$ time.\n\n> Now suppose we are looking at some modified command set $C'$, where we have changed some position $i$ from 'jmp' to 'nop' (or vice versa). \nLet $j$ be the position after executing the (modified) line $i$. I claim that:\n\n>    (Lemma 1) $j$ leads to victory in $C'$ if and only if $j$ leads to victory in $C$. This means we only need to check in $j$ is in WINNING.\n\n> So, we can just follow along $C$; every time we see a 'nop' or 'jmp', change it to the other instruction and see if that lands you in WINNING. If so, \nfinish out the rest of the alg and return acc. If not, proceed without modifying the command. This part of the algorithm also takes O(N).\nFinally, let me prove Lemma 1.\n\n> Forwards direction: Suppose $j$ leads to victory in $C'$. If $j$ eventually leads back to $i$ (in $C'$), we are in an infinite loop. Therefore, the path \nfrom $j$ to victory in $C'$ does not include $i$. Hence, this path is unchanged between $C$ and $C'$, so $j$ also leads to victory in $C$.\nBackwards direction: Suppose $j$ leads to victory in $C$. If $j$ leads to $i$ (in $C$), then $i$ also leads to victory in $C$. But this is \nimpossible since $i$ is part of the initial infinite loop in $C$. Therefore, $j$'s path to victory does not include $i$. Proceeding as in the previous \ncase, we conclude that $j$ also leads to victory in $C'$. (Note that we weren't able to use the exact same argument as the previous case, because \n$i$ doesn't necessarily lead to $j$ in $C$!)\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00009-e308c8a3-1c72-4a65-a654-d96630aae76d","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is awesome!
