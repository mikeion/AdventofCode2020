In fact, it looks like you'll even have time to grab some food: all flights are currently delayed due to issues in luggage processing.\n\nDue to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!\n\nFor example, consider the following rules:\n\n```\nlight red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.\ndark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.\nbright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.\nmuted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.\nshiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.\ndark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.\nvibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.\nfaded blue bags contain no other bags.\ndotted black bags contain no other bags.\n```\nThese rules specify the required contents for 9 bag types. In this example, every faded blue bag is empty, every vibrant plum bag contains \n11 bags (5 faded blue and 6 dotted black), and so on.\n\nYou have a shiny gold bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag? \n(In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one shiny gold bag?)\n\nIn the above rules, the following options would be available to you:\n\nA bright white bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly.\nA muted yellow bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly, plus some other bags.\nA dark orange bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.\nA light red bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.\nSo, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag is 4.\n\nHow many bag colors can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag? (The list of rules is quite long; make sure you get all of it.)","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-56626c5b-8ebd-49e6-b583-2605382495de","output_cleared":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"d9ab5b4f","execution_millis":1,"cell_id":"00001-716f4a36-a115-43e1-b436-e77e59e61634","execution_start":1607433160620,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import re\nbags = list(map(str, open('day7_example.txt', 'r').read().split('\\n')))","execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"2c75d1b8","execution_millis":2,"cell_id":"00002-ffa3b22a-bc98-4279-b00f-4635ec3c1da6","execution_start":1607433160625,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"bags[0:3]","execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":15,"data":{"text/plain":"['light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.',\n 'dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.',\n 'bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.']"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"8f043c9f","execution_millis":0,"cell_id":"00003-25533976-cc82-4ba4-a571-2aa61c92c874","execution_start":1607433160636,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"re.findall('([\\w ]*) bags contain ', bags[0])","execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":16,"data":{"text/plain":"['light red']"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"801fb049","execution_millis":3,"cell_id":"00004-3f252c4c-fd6a-403f-8542-488927534eda","execution_start":1607433160637,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"re.findall('(\\d+) ([\\w ]*) bag(?:s)?', bags[0])","execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":17,"data":{"text/plain":"[('1', 'bright white'), ('2', 'muted yellow')]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"da00b3a4","execution_millis":18,"cell_id":"00005-35aa1f78-9ce2-40fc-a5b4-510d519473a0","execution_start":1607433160649,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Let's set up an empty dictionary for the rules\n\nset_of_rules = {}\n\n# now let's go through the rules.
