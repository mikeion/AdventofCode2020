While you consider checking the in-flight menu \nfor one of those drinks that come with a little umbrella, you are interrupted by the kid sitting next to you.\n\nTheir handheld game console won't turn on! They ask if you can take a look.\n\nYou narrow the problem down to a strange infinite loop in the boot code (your puzzle input) of the device. \nYou should be able to fix it, but first you need to be able to run the code in isolation.\n\nThe boot code is represented as a text file with one instruction per line of text. Each instruction consists of an operation \n(acc, jmp, or nop) and an argument (a signed number like +4 or -20).\n\nacc increases or decreases a single global value called the accumulator by the value given in the argument. For example, acc +7 would increase the accumulator \nby 7. The accumulator starts at 0. After an acc instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.\njmp jumps to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an offset from the jmp instruction; \nfor example, jmp +2 would skip the next instruction, jmp +1 would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and jmp -20 \nwould cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.\nnop stands for No OPeration - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it is executed next.\nFor example, consider the following program:\n```\nnop +0\nacc +1\njmp +4\nacc +3\njmp -3\nacc -99\nacc +1\njmp -4\nacc +6\n```\nThese instructions are visited in this order:\n```\nnop +0  | 1\nacc +1  | 2, 8(!)\njmp +4  | 3\nacc +3  | 6\njmp -3  | 7\nacc -99 |\nacc +1  | 4\njmp -4  | 5\nacc +6  |\n```\nFirst, the nop +0 does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (acc +1) \nand jmp +4 sets the next instruction to the other acc +1 near the bottom. \nAfter it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, jmp -4 executes, setting the next instruction to the only acc +3. It sets the accumulator to 5, \nand jmp -3 causes the program to continue back at the first acc +1.\n\nThis is an infinite loop: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the program tries to run any instruction a second time, \nyou know it will never terminate.\n\nImmediately before the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator is 5.\n\nRun your copy of the boot code. Immediately before any instruction is executed a second time, what value is in the accumulator?","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-62318598-10e2-4427-beac-8564eeeef904","output_cleared":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"41930bec","execution_millis":0,"cell_id":"00001-54dec764-81ae-49a2-86d9-9c7b8d78b781","execution_start":1607425321775,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import re","execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"a94d9c3a","execution_millis":2,"cell_id":"00002-75f5b8ac-376d-47e2-af83-139a4a8a0ce4","execution_start":1607425322387,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"instructions = list(map(str, open('day8_example.txt', 'r').read().split('\\n')))","execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"8774178d","execution_millis":2,"cell_id":"00003-20d5290e-a9e6-43e0-8b84-bc1d17e524c2","execution_start":1607425322935,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"instructions[0:5]","execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":23,"data":{"text/plain":"['nop +0', 'acc +1', 'jmp +4', 'acc +3', 'jmp -3']"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"l = list(range(len(instructions)-1))\nprint(l)","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-7e9f61e9-481a-4390-bfde-4adcc66eacc1","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"97fd3b4e","execution_millis":3,"execution_start":1607425325727,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"aca5adb","execution_millis":2,"cell_id":"00004-8dc42dae-a35b-4989-8786-b45e11aa28e1","execution_start":1607428900206,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"def run_program(instructions):\n    d_count = {} # empty dictionary to store counts of list index.
